<h2>What Is Methylene Blue?</h2>
<p>Methylene Blue is a dye used in labs and medicine for over a century. In low doses, it works as a <strong>nootropic</strong> and <strong>antioxidant</strong>. It helps mitochondria make more ATP, the energy your cells use. Swisschems sells a high-purity powder you can dose yourself.</p>
